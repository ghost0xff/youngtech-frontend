# Abandoned: Frontend for YoungTech E-commerce

Project is incomplete :'v

This was a frontend for this project => https://github.com/samu22cr/youngtech-backend
but now is deprecated, since I decided to rewrite all the frontend.

Reason why I'm abandoning this project is because of the frontend tech stack
I chose when I started this project. I chose to use Nextjs + MUI because
I had no idea how bad of a combination that was, it was a bad idea because
MUI is pretty client-side focused and Nextjs's App Router (which I was using)
is more SSR focused.


Also, I hate MUI. It's to bloated and has a lot of weird magic tricks. I 
don't like that with MUI I can only extend to a certain point the style
of my web app. I need more flexibility when it comes to UI/UX and MUI
limits my creativity. In addition, I wish to learn how all the underlying
abstractions of all this npm packages actually work.


I'm probably going to switch to Nextjs + TailwindCSS or even try out
other none-react (or even none-js) tools, like Svelte or HTMX


NOTE: Some features of the actual project might not even work
since project isn't going to be mantained and the API of the 
backend will probably change
